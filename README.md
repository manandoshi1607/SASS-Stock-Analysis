# SASS-Stock-Analysis
An Angular + Spring Boot + MongoDB project that empowers stock market traders to take more informed and calculated trading decisions.

# Abstract
A stock market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks, which represent ownership claims on businesses. These may include securities listed on a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately. A stock represents a claim on the company's assets and earnings. With a multitude of companies getting their stocks listed on a public stock exchange, it gets difficult to keep up with a particular preferred stock and to miss out on important upcoming ones that are sure to be on an upward trend. Our solution is built with the following features:
* Generates buying and selling signals based on technical indicators metrics, trend analysis, learnings from historic data and recent fluctuations in stock prices tested using a rich dataset of over 20 years sourced using AlphaVantage API.
* Presented the collected findings through an engaging dashboard filled with charts and insightful data like support and resistance using Angular 6, Bootstrap and ng2-charts.
*	Scheduled notifications to subscribed users through e-mails using Java Mail API and Thymeleaf
* Top curated articles that cover all the latest stock news posted using the Admin dashboard.
